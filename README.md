# Promised Land

This repo was designed the introduce people to the use of Promises in JavaScript and to help
people avoid the common pitfalls with asynchronous code especially within node.

### How to use

The commit history of this repo demonstrates a few steps to understanding and implementing
promises. The first commit includes an example test suite that has only one failing tests,
the failure however is due to a misunderstood understanding of JavaScript and nodes callbacks.

For each step:

    npm install
    npm test
